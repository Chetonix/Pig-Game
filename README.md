# Pig-Game
I have created this game as a portfolio project.
 The link to the game-website is here: https://chetonix.github.io/Pig-Game/

 Directions on how to play: As you roll the dice, the current scores gets incremented each time with the dice roll until you hold it, it's when the current score is added to the total score and the next player gets the chance to play; or until the dice rolls 1, it's when the current score gets nullified and the next player gets the chance. The player who gets to a total score of 50 first wins the game!
